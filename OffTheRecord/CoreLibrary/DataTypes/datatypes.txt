OTRv4 uses many of the data types already specified in OTRv3 specification:

Bytes (BYTE):
  1 byte unsigned value
Shorts (SHORT):
  2 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Ints (INT):
  4 byte unsigned value, big-endian
Multi-precision integers (MPI):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte unsigned value, big-endian
  (MPIs must use the minimum-length encoding; i.e. no leading 0x00 bytes.
   This is important when calculating public key fingerprints)
Opaque variable-length data (DATA):
  4 byte unsigned len, big-endian
  len byte data
OTRv4 also uses the following data types:

Nonce (NONCE):
  Always set to 0
  12 bytes data

Message Authentication Code (MAC):
  64 bytes MAC data

Ed448 point (POINT):
  57 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

Ed448 scalar (SCALAR):
  57 bytes as defined in "Encoding and Decoding" section, little-endian

Client Profile (CLIENT-PROF):

Prekey Profile (PREKEY-PROF)
