## Planning
 + [ ] Get Build going on CI (fan of circleci...suggest main author get initial build then provides access to me and others.) then running tests.
 bk: i had already setup azure devops pipeline. We can still consider circleci? I already had it running against travisci but removed that.
 + [ ] Planning for test app (Suggest Avalon)
 bk: will need to look into this... url?
